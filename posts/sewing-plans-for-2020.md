title: Sewing Plans for 2020

summary: My personal plans for 2020 are fairly simple. I didn't want to
  overwhelm myself with a commitment I couldn't keep. I decided to have three
  patterns in the "I pledge to make" category and I have two others in the "if I
  have time leftover" category.

On top of these patterns I want to make, I want to make sure that I'm very intentional with my closet in this new year and next few years. I say I don't want to buy any *new* clothes. I say that, but if I keep to it, well we'll see. I want to only buy things I need second hand and then I want to make the rest myself. 

So, here they are.  The three garments I *will* make next year are the Yanta Overalls by (link: https://helensclosetpatterns.com/product/yanta-overalls-pdf-pattern/ text: Helen's Closet popup: yes), Estuary Skirt by (link: https://sewliberated.com/products/estuary-skirt-digital-sewing-pattern text: Sew Liberated popup: yes), and the Wilder Gown by (link: https://fridaypatterncompany.com/products/the-wilder-gown-pdf-pattern text: Friday Pattern Company popup: yes). If I have enough time to, I also want to make the Ilford Jacket by (link: https://fridaypatterncompany.com/products/the-ilford-jacket-pdf-pattern text: Friday Pattern Company popup: yes) and the Persephone Pants by (link: http://annaallenclothing.com/persephone-pants text: Anna Allen Clothing popup: yes).

That's the plan, Stan.

Update 2/28/2020: I have completed TWO Estuary skirts so far and I have TWO Wilder Gowns almost done. I have the Yanta Overalls pattern and the fabric ((link: https://www.fabric.com/buy/ff-334/kaufman-essex-linen-blend-black text: a lovely Essex Linen blend from fabric.com)) for it and I'm going for that next. Either I need to slow down or I can handle more sewing than I thought. â˜º
