Hello! I've been an artist and maker my whole life. After studying graphic design in 2011, I combined my love of sewing with my new love of illustration and began designing my own fabric to use in my sewing projects. In 2016 I started a business called [Bashful Birdie Handmade](http://bashfulbirdie.com/) where I sew products with my custom designed fabric. I'm also one half of the husband and wife design collab, [Before The Ink Is Dry](http://beforetheinkisdry.tumblr.com/).

I have always been heavily influenced by the psychedelic and nature focused art of the 60s and 70s as well as artists such as Mary Blair and Alexander Girard. The focus of my works are primarily florals, with my medium of choice being gouache. I also work digitally and enjoy the process of making my digital work look and flow with my traditional work.
