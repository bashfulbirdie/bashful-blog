Hello! I've been an artist and maker my whole life. After studying graphic design in 2011, I combined my love of sewing with my new love of illustration and began designing my own fabric to use in my sewing projects. In 2016, I started a business called *Bashful Birdie Handmade* where I sew products with my custom designed fabric. Currently, I'm working on a portfolio of paintings focused on artwork for children's books.

I have always been heavily influenced by the psychedelic and nature focused art of the 60s and 70s as well as artists such as Mary Blair and Alexander Girard. My medium of choice is traditional gouache. Some of my hobbies include, sewing clothes for myself, torturing my family with my banjo playing, and growing cool and tasty plants in my garden.
